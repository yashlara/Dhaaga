# Dhaaga-ecommerce-website
Dhaaga is an e-commerce website I developed. Dhaaga aims to be a leading online clothes seller. The user interface has been designed keeping the customer's needs and preferences in mind with an aim to make the user experience as enjoyable and pleasant as possible. All the icons, the logo and the other widgets have been designed by me using Adobe Photoshop.
